# How to Land on the Moon
<h6>June 2025</h6>

I wanted to land the damn <a href="https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/lunar_lander/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thing</a>. How hard could it be? You grab an RL algorithm, point it at the environment, and let the GPU figure it out. That was the theory anyway. The practice is in my `failed_attempts` folder.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49484395-6957-40c9-bba7-6a5ba4bb52ee" alt="Lunar Lander" style="width:100%;max-width:500px;" />

The first *real* attempt was `lander2.py`. This wasn't just a copy-paste job. It had GAE, PPO clipping, separate optimizers for the actor and critic, LayerNorm... the works. It was getting closer. It could sometimes avoid immediate fiery death, which felt like progress. But it wasn't landing.

But reinforcement learning is hard. Unlike supervised learning where your errors are independent, in RL, your model makes an error, and that error changes the next state you see. The errors compound. The lander would learn a perfect, stable hover, draining fuel until the episode timed out and it dropped like a rock. It was gaming the reward system, getting a decent score for simply not exploding on impact. But it wasn't landing.

I did make it land, eventually. Here's [the code](https://github.com/utkarshgill/lunar_lander).

## This is how you do it

Run multiple environments in parallel. The rewards are sparse. More examples, more diversity, faster convergence.

```python
env_name = 'LunarLanderContinuous-v3'
state_dim = 8
action_dim = 2
num_envs = int(os.getenv('NUM_ENVS', 8))
```

Define the network. The actor outputs actions, and the critic estimates state values. The tanh keeps the actions in the range [-1, 1]. The critic learns the value function. A value function is a scalar that estimates the cumulative expected discounted return for a state.

```python
class ActorCritic(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_dim, action_dim, hidden_dim):
        super(ActorCritic, self).__init__()
        # Actor network
        self.actor_fc1 = nn.Linear(state_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.actor_fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.actor_out = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, action_dim)
        
        # Critic network
        self.critic_fc1 = nn.Linear(state_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.critic_fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.critic_out = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, 1)

    def forward(self, state):
        x = F.relu(self.actor_fc1(state))
        x = F.relu(self.actor_fc2(x))
        action_mean = torch.tanh(self.actor_out(x))
        
        v = F.relu(self.critic_fc1(state))
        v = F.relu(self.critic_fc2(v))
        value = self.critic_out(v)
        
        return action_mean, value
```
 
Store rollout data in lists.

```python
class Memory:
    def __init__(self):
        self.states = []
        self.actions = []
        self.logprobs = []
        self.rewards = []
        self.is_terminals = []
```

Define the PPO policy. Mathematically, a policy is a mapping from states to actions. In RL, the policy is a function that takes a state and outputs an action. Here, the policy is parameterized by a neural network. Note that the actor and critic are optimized separately.

```python
class PPO:
    def __init__(self, actor_critic, lr_actor, lr_critic, gamma, lamda, K_epochs, eps_clip, action_std, batch_size):
        self.actor_critic = actor_critic
        # Use separate optimizers for actor and critic to decouple updates
        actor_params = [p for n, p in actor_critic.named_parameters() if 'actor_' in n]
        critic_params = [p for n, p in actor_critic.named_parameters() if 'critic_' in n]
        self.actor_optimizer = optim.Adam(actor_params, lr=lr_actor)
        self.critic_optimizer = optim.Adam(critic_params, lr=lr_critic)
        self.gamma = gamma
        self.lamda = lamda
        self.K_epochs = K_epochs
        self.eps_clip = eps_clip
        self.action_std = action_std
        self.batch_size = batch_size
```

<b>Why PPO</b>

There are a bunch of RL algorithms to choose from. [OpenAI's Spinning Up](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/user/algorithms.html) lists the main ones:

- **Vanilla Policy Gradient (VPG)**: Basic policy gradients from the 80s/90s
- **Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)**: Stable but annoying to implement
- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: TRPO without the headache
- **Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)**: Off-policy, fast but unstable
- **Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3)**: DDPG with fixes
- **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)**: Good sample efficiency, entropy regularization

[Karpathy's Pong post](https://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/) explains why policy gradients are appealingâ€”they directly optimize expected reward. But there's a catch. Policy gradients are slow because you're essentially doing gradient ascent on a noisy function. Each episode gives you one sample of the return, and that sample has high variance. You need thousands of episodes to get a decent gradient estimate. This is why RL takes forever compared to supervised learning where you have clean labels.

[Schulman et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347) solved the stability problem of policy gradients with a clever trick: clip the objective function.

The PPO loss is defined like this:

$$L^{CLIP}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_t \left[ \min \left( r_t(\theta) \hat{A}_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon) \hat{A}_t \right) \right]$$

Where $r_t(\theta) = \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{old}}(a_t|s_t)}$ is the probability ratio and $\hat{A}_t$ is the advantage.

When the ratio gets too big (policy changed too much), the gradient gets clipped. This prevents catastrophic policy updates that would ruin your training. It's way simpler than TRPO's trust region math but gives you similar stability. A fancy way of saying "don't change the policy too much".

I picked PPO because it works. It's reliable, the implementation is straightforward, and it converges (relatively) quickly.

Actions are sampled from a Gaussian distribution centered around the actor's predicted mean. This encourages exploration during training.

```python
def select_action(self, state, memory):
    state_tensor = torch.as_tensor(state, dtype=torch.float32)
    with torch.no_grad():
        action_mean, _ = self.actor_critic(state_tensor)
        std_tensor = torch.ones_like(action_mean) * self.action_std
        dist = torch.distributions.Normal(action_mean, std_tensor)
        action = dist.sample()
        action_logprob = dist.log_prob(action).sum(-1)
    return action.detach().cpu().numpy()
```

Compute advantages using Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE). GAE balances bias and variance, improving the stability of policy updates.

```python
def compute_advantages(self, rewards, state_values, is_terminals):
    T, N = rewards.shape
    device = rewards.device
    returns = torch.zeros_like(rewards)
    
    state_values_pad = torch.cat([state_values, state_values[-1:]], dim=0)
    gae = torch.zeros(N, device=device)
    for t in reversed(range(T)):
        delta = rewards[t] + self.gamma * state_values_pad[t + 1] * (1 - is_terminals[t]) - state_values_pad[t]
        gae = delta + self.gamma * self.lamda * (1 - is_terminals[t]) * gae
        returns[t] = gae + state_values_pad[t]

    advantages = returns - state_values_pad[:-1]
    return advantages.reshape(-1), returns.reshape(-1)
```

Implement PPO clipping to constrain policy updates. This prevents excessively large updates that could destabilize training.

```python
ratios = torch.exp(action_logprobs - batch_logprobs.detach())
surr1 = ratios * batch_advantages
surr2 = torch.clamp(ratios, 1 - self.eps_clip, 1 + self.eps_clip) * batch_advantages
actor_loss = -torch.min(surr1, surr2).mean()
```

The actor and critic updates happen separately within each batch.

```python
# Update actor
self.actor_optimizer.zero_grad()
actor_loss.backward(retain_graph=True)
torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(
    [p for n, p in self.actor_critic.named_parameters() if 'actor_' in n],
    max_norm=0.5
)
self.actor_optimizer.step()

# Update critic  
self.critic_optimizer.zero_grad()
critic_loss.backward()
torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(
    [p for n, p in self.actor_critic.named_parameters() if 'critic_' in n],
    max_norm=1.0
)
self.critic_optimizer.step()
```

The critic loss is simple mean squared error between predicted and target values.

```python
critic_loss = F.mse_loss(state_values, batch_returns)
```

The update function uses mini-batches and multiple epochs to squeeze learning from each rollout.

```python
dataset = TensorDataset(old_states, old_actions, old_logprobs, advantages, returns)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=self.batch_size, shuffle=True)

for _ in range(self.K_epochs):
    for batch in dataloader:
        batch_states, batch_actions, batch_logprobs, batch_advantages, batch_returns = batch
        # Compute losses and update networks
```

The main training loop collects rollouts and triggers updates periodically.

```python
def train(env_name, max_episodes, max_timesteps, update_timestep, log_interval, state_dim, action_dim, hidden_dim, lr_actor, lr_critic, gamma, K_epochs, eps_clip, action_std, gae_lambda, batch_size, num_envs=1):

    while completed_episodes < max_episodes:
        actions = ppo.select_action(states, memory)
        next_states, rewards, terminated, truncated, _ = env.step(actions)
        memory.rewards.append(rewards)

        # the rest of the lines give you speed (parallelism), logging, and plotting

        if timestep % update_timestep == 0:
            ppo.update(memory)
            memory.clear_memory()
        
        states = next_states
```

Evaluate the policy without exploration noise using deterministic actions.

```python
def evaluate_policy(env_name, actor_critic, max_timesteps, num_envs=16):
    env = gym.vector.SyncVectorEnv([lambda: gym.make(env_name) for _ in range(num_envs)])
    states, _ = env.reset()
    total_rewards = np.zeros(num_envs, dtype=np.float32)
    
    with torch.no_grad():
        for _ in range(max_timesteps):
            action_mean, _ = actor_critic(torch.as_tensor(states, dtype=torch.float32))
            actions_np = action_mean.cpu().numpy()  # No sampling, deterministic
            states, rewards, terminated, truncated, _ = env.step(actions_np)
            total_rewards += rewards
    
    return float(total_rewards.mean())
```

Once solved, render the policy for human observation.

```python
def render_policy(env_name, actor_critic, max_timesteps):
    env = gym.make(env_name, render_mode='human')
    state, _ = env.reset()
    
    with torch.no_grad():
        for _ in range(max_timesteps):
            action_mean, _ = actor_critic(torch.as_tensor(state, dtype=torch.float32).unsqueeze(0))
            action = action_mean.squeeze(0).cpu().numpy()
            state, reward, done, trunc, _ = env.step(action)
            if done or trunc:
                break
```

Training stops when evaluation consistently hits the target score (200 is fine, but arguably stricter 240 gives you a better policy).

The solution wasnâ€™t fancy. The solution is `beautiful_lander.py`, and itâ€™s a basic PPO implementation with every screw tightened.

1. Curse of sparsity: One environment is too slow. You need an multiple landers learning in parallel. gym.vector.SyncVectorEnv was the first real step forward. More data, more diversity, less time.

2. Punish cheating. The hovering agent was a problem. The fix is a penalty of -100 for not landing. No more gaming the system.

3. Stability is everything. PPO is notoriously unstable. You have to chain it down.
    * Orthogonal initialization so the network doesnâ€™t explode on the first pass.
    * Gradient clipping so the updates arenâ€™t insane.
    * Value function clipping so the critic doesnâ€™t get too far ahead of itself.
    * (Optional) An entropy bonus that decays over time. This forces it to explore early and exploit later.
    * (Optional) An adaptive learning rate that slows down if the policy starts thrashing.
    

The final hyperparameters arenâ€™t magic numbers. They are scars from a thousand failed runs. The actorâ€™s learning rate (2e-4) is slower than the criticâ€™s (8e-4), because we let the critic lead. Gamma is high (0.995) because the future really, really matters.

Itâ€™s a pile of heuristics. But it works. It lands on the moon. Beautifully. Within 500 episodes, reliably.

The algorithm is a small part of the solution. Most of the work is tuning the training process, monitoring the learning curves, and identifying the ways your agent finds shortcuts instead of learning the intended behavior.

_One small step for a policy, one giant leap for my GPU bill._
